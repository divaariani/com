            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>
              Pond and aquaculture management often involves manual, repetitive, and time-consuming tasks. Farmers and pond owners face several challenges such as monitoring water conditions, managing pump operations, and maintaining filtration systemsâ€”typically without automation or remote control. Additionally, financial tracking and business planning remain fragmented, with no centralized system for managing income, expenses, debts, or cultivation costs. This lack of integrated tools results in increased operational costs, potential harm to aquatic life, and inefficiencies in overall management.

          <div class="portfolio-description">
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>
                This app designed to simplify and automate aquaculture and pond management for farmers, pond owners, and aquaculture professionals. Banoo leverages IoT integration to allow users to remotely monitor and control pond devices, including checking connectivity and toggling equipment on or off from their smartphones.
                Beyond device control, Banoo also addresses the business side of aquaculture with built-in financial management tools, enabling users to record and track income, expenses, debts, receivables, and loans. A cultivation calculator helps estimate costs and profits, aiding in business planning and decision-making.
                Built using the Flutter Dart framework for cross-platform functionality, Banoo combines smart automation with practical tools to enhance operational efficiency, reduce manual labor, and improve profitability for its users.
